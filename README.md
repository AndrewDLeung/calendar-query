# Calendar Query
How do I spend my time in college? Let's find out. 

## Description
When asking people on campus what they did, what they're doing, or what they're going to do today, 
you always get the same answer: "work." This got me thinking about how much time I spend on work everday at college. 

In this project, I answered two questions:
1. What type of work do I spend the most time one?
2. How does my time spent doing work compare to my expectations?

## Methods
Over the two week collection period (9/12/22 - 9/25/22), I used Google Calendar and the app Toggl to collect data.

Prior to starting an assignment, I blocked out time on Google Calendar to represent my expectation
for how long it would take.

Once I began, I then started the timer in Toggl until the assignment was finished. 
If I had to end the timer to go to class or an extracurricular activity before my work was finished, 
a new timer can simply be started with the same name as the pervious one.
